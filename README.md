# TASK-1 - Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

## Overview

Welcome to the Credit Card Fraud Detection project! This repository showcases a data science project that focuses on detecting fraudulent activities in credit card transactions using machine learning techniques.

## Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can identify potential instances of credit card fraud based on transaction data.

## Key Libraries Used

The following Python libraries were instrumental in the development and analysis of the Credit Card Fraud Detection project:

- **Scikit-learn (Sklearn):** Utilized for building machine learning models, including classifiers for fraud detection based on transaction data.

- **Pandas:** Used for data manipulation and analysis, facilitating the handling of the credit card transaction dataset.

- **Matplotlib and Seaborn:** Employed for data visualization to gain insights into the distribution of features and visualizing model performance.

- **Jupyter Notebooks:** Used as the interactive computing environment for developing, experimenting, and documenting the analysis process.

- **Imbalanced-learn:** Applied to handle class imbalance in the dataset, a common challenge in credit card fraud detection tasks.

- **NumPy:** Utilized for numerical operations and computations in data preprocessing and model training.

These libraries, in conjunction with Python, formed the foundation for building, training, and evaluating the credit card fraud detection model.
